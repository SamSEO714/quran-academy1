# SEO, GEO and AEO playbook

Research date: 8 October 2026. Based on the live sites and search results for "online quran classes" in the USA, UK and Australia.

## 1. Who to study, and what each one teaches you

| Site | Study it for | What they do |
|---|---|---|
| riwaqalquran.com | Site structure and trust | About 25 course pages under 5 categories, a separate Female Quran Tutors page, a profile page for every instructor, a pricing page, video testimonials, a mobile app. Home page states 9+ years, 3,000+ students, 40+ countries. Two CTAs: Free Session and Free Consultation. |
| quranayat.com | Audience segmentation and offers | About 45 course pages cut by audience (Hifz for kids, for adults, for ladies; Tajweed for sisters). Separate landing pages for paid traffic. Names USA, UK, Canada and Australia in the meta description. 25% off the first month, family discount, a pay-per-class price, UK and US phone numbers and addresses. Long FAQ on the home page including the cost question. |
| kalimah-center.com | Country pages and AEO | `/online-quran-classes-in-australia/` opens with a definition, has a table of contents, local facts (Muslim population, suburb names), Australian time zones, a price in AUD, 8 FAQs, a named author and a Trustpilot link. They publish new posts almost daily. |
| studioarabiya.com | Brand authority | US-based. "Trusted by 50,000+ students, 15+ years". Prices from $55 a month. US phone number, family plans, group courses, services for Islamic schools, sponsorship of MAS, ICNA and ISNA. They win on reputation and offline presence, not on page count. |
| hidayahnetwork.com | What to avoid | Good title tag and a tutor directory, but the home page carries leftover template text and broken figures. Sloppy pages are an opening for a cleaner site. |

### Patterns across the search results

1. **Every ranking academy leads with a free trial.** It is the entry price of the market, not a differentiator.
2. **Country names are in titles and H1s.** "Online Quran classes UK / USA / Australia" pages are separate URLs with local time zones, cities and currency.
3. **Audience pages rank on their own:** for kids, for adults, for sisters, female Quran teacher.
4. **Prices are published.** Budget academies: about $30 to $60 a month for 2 to 5 half-hour classes a week. Premium, US-based brands: $55 a month and up. Per hour: about $6 to $25.
5. **Third-party profiles rank on page one:** Trustpilot, about.me, FreeIndex, Sortlist, Vocal and similar. A Trustpilot page for your brand is both a ranking asset and a trust signal.
6. **Exact-match domains exist** (onlinequranacademy.uk, onlinequranacademy.us), but the stronger sites are brands with depth.
7. **Weak spots you can beat:** thin copy with keywords repeated, no real answer near the top, unverifiable student numbers, no named teachers, slow WordPress pages loaded with plugins.

## 2. How this site is positioned against them

| They do | This site does |
|---|---|
| Keyword-stuffed paragraphs | A direct answer in the first 60 words, then specifics |
| Fees hidden or in one currency | Fees in USD, GBP, AUD and CAD, in tables, on every relevant page |
| "24/7 classes" | Class-time tables in each country's own time zones |
| Heavy WordPress themes | Static HTML, self-hosted fonts, no images to wait for |
| Claims without proof | No numbers until you supply real ones; teacher and review sections switch on when filled |
| One generic form | Forms that pre-select country, course and teacher by page, and record the campaign |

## 4. GEO and AEO: being the answer AI assistants give

AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Google AI Overviews) quote pages that state facts plainly and can be verified elsewhere.

**Already built in**
- Answer-first paragraphs, question headings, tables and short lists
- FAQ, Course, Service and Organization schema
- `/llms.txt` with fees, courses and FAQs in plain text
- AI crawlers allowed in `robots.txt`
- "Last reviewed" dates on key pages
- The dashboard labels leads that arrive from ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude and Copilot as "AI assistant"

**You need to add**
1. **Real people.** Fill in `story` and `teachers` in `site.ts`: names, qualifications, years teaching.
2. **Mentions on other sites.** Assistants recommend brands they see in several independent places. Get listed and reviewed on Trustpilot and Google Business Profile, and answer questions on Reddit (r/islam, r/MuslimLounge, r/converts) and Quora as a teacher, not as an advertiser.
3. **Original numbers.** Publish something only you have, such as average months to finish the Qaida across your students. Original data gets cited.
4. **Consistency.** The same name, fees and trial offer everywhere. Conflicting facts make assistants skip you.

## 5. Running on a subdomain (quran.pajee.org)

Google treats a subdomain largely as its own site, so `quran.pajee.org` has to earn its own rankings. These steps make sure the two sites help each other.

1. **Link from pajee.org to the academy** in the main menu and the footer, with the words "Online Quran classes". This is the most valuable link the academy will get at the start.
2. **Search Console:** add `pajee.org` as a *Domain* property (DNS verification). It covers every subdomain, so the academy's data appears there too. Submit `https://quran.pajee.org/sitemap.xml`.
3. **Bing Webmaster Tools:** add `quran.pajee.org` as its own site and submit the same sitemap.
4. **One address only.** Always link to `https://quran.pajee.org/...`, never to the `vercel.app` address. The site's canonical tags already point to the subdomain.
5. **Same name everywhere:** "Rehal Quran Academy" (or the final name) on the site, Trustpilot, social profiles and directories.
6. **Explain the name.** The About page says what Rehal and Pajee mean and who runs the academy. Keep that paragraph: it answers the first question a new visitor has about an unfamiliar name.
7. **pajee.online:** keep it registered and forward it permanently (301 redirect) to `https://pajee.org`, so nobody else can use it and any visitor who types it still arrives. Do not build a second copy of the site on it.

## 6. Off-page plan

| Priority | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools: verify, submit `/sitemap.xml`. Bing matters because ChatGPT search draws on its index. |
| 2 | Trustpilot profile. Ask every family for a review after their first month. |
| 3 | Google Business Profile, if you have a real address you can verify. |
| 4 | Social profiles with the same name and description: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok. Add the links to `site.ts`. |
| 5 | YouTube: short lesson clips (one Tajweed rule, one Qaida lesson). Link each to the matching course page. Video results appear for most Quran-learning searches. |
| 6 | Muslim directories and community sites in each country: mosque websites, Islamic school directories, Muslim parenting blogs, local Muslim Facebook groups. |
| 7 | Guest articles for Muslim parenting and homeschooling blogs in the USA and UK. |

Avoid bulk profile links and paid link packages. Competitors use them and they are the first thing a Google update removes.

## 7. Content plan after launch

Publish two guides a week for the first three months. Start with the questions that have buying intent:

- Online Quran classes for 4, 5 and 6 year olds: what to expect
- Online Quran classes vs mosque madrasah: an honest comparison
- How to help your child practise Quran at home in 10 minutes a day
- Best time of day for Hifz
- Learn Quran online for reverts: where to begin
- Hafs vs Warsh: which recitation should I learn?
- How to revise Quran you have forgotten
- Quran classes in Ramadan: how to plan the month
- City pages once you have students there: London, Birmingham, Houston, Chicago, Toronto, Sydney, Melbourne

Every guide: the question as the title, a 40 to 60 word answer first, one table or list, three related questions, and a link to one course page.

## 8. First 90 days

| When | Do |
|---|---|
| Week 1 | Finalise the organisation name. Fill in `site.ts`. Connect `quran.pajee.org`. Confirm fees and policies. Deploy. Verify Search Console and Bing. Submit the sitemap. |
| Week 2 | Create Trustpilot and social profiles. Connect GA4 and the Meta Pixel. Send a test lead and check it reaches the dashboard and your email. |
| Weeks 3 to 4 | Start paid traffic to the country pages with UTM tags, so the forms prove themselves while organic rankings build. Publish the first four guides. |
| Month 2 | Add teacher profiles and the first real reviews. Publish two guides a week. Start YouTube clips. |
| Month 3 | Check Search Console for queries ranking in positions 8 to 20 and improve those pages first. Add city pages where you now have students. |

Organic rankings for a new domain in this market usually take three to six months to show. Paid traffic to the country pages is how you get leads in the meantime.
